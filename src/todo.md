# DIRECTORY:

* adding members manually
  -check for discrepancies in members that have been added or need to be removed
  - make format the same, ("last name, first name")

* ministering page has separate part where you can manually change people around
based on who needs to be a focus


# MINISTERING COMPNAIONSHIPS:

notify if there are any members not listed in a household. those can either be ignored for ministering assignments or operation cancelled

determine households where there are an odd # of elders

  - ?? place with roommates or other individuals?

# MINISTERING ASSIGNMENTS:

determine total # Elders, and total # sisters

  - (# elders)/2 = # companionships
  - # sisters / # companionships = # of sisters per comp

if # sisters is even per comp then default is that #/2 from each apartment when possible.  Call this the target_split

otherwise it is (#/2)+1, when result subtracted from total # per comp is not 1

# Households

determine households with just one elder or sister
   
  - add to a list

determine households where there are an odd # of sisters

  - example: size of target_split is 3... if there are 5 sisters in a house, 3 would go to one companionship, the other 2 would be with another.
  - if there were 4 sisters in a house and the target_split is 3 then ideally all 4 sisters go with one companionship while another 2-sister house is added for that comp.  Otherwise do 2 from this house and 3 from another. any leftover individuals will be given to this companionship



                 ----------------------------------------
- [ ] split all men's households into 3 sub-groups. (each presidency member's household is added to their list)
- [ ] split sister's households into 3 sub-groups
  - order alphabetically by household address..
    - find 3 indices within list of households (each at start of 1/3 portion) once each sub group reaches that 1/3 portion size then add extra households
    - go through list and add one household from each 1/3-portion to sub-group

- determine how many people in each.  If difference is more than the two smallest apartments
- group 1 ministers to 2, 2 --> 3, 3 --> 1 ... (this avoids overlap)

an apartment with an even number of people will
